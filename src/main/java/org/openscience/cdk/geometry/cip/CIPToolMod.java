/**
 * This modified version of {@link CIPTool} is just present temporarily to correct
 * a CIP bug in CDK. CDK's default CIP rule works well, but has a bug in the recursive
 * part where, if there's a tie between 2 ligands based on atomic number/mass, it will
 * then get all sub-ligands and compare them. The issue is that each set of sub-ligands
 * is sorted by a mass+atomic number only priority, and each sub-ligand from the parent
 * ligand is compared only to its matched counterpart, not to all potentially higher 
 * priority ligands.
 *  
 *  <pre>
 * Consider this case below (4S)-2,3,4,5-tetramethyloctane:  
 *  
 *     3'    5'
 *     M     C
 *     |  4  | 
 * M-C-C-[C]-C-C-C-M
 *   | 3  :  5
 *   M    M
 *        4'
 * 
 * M = Methyl
 * C = Carbon
 * : = Dashed bond
 * # = Locant 
 * </pre>
 *                 
 * The 4 postion [C] is a stereo center with S configuration (as demonstrated
 * with the : dashed bond to the methyl group below). The carbon atoms at 3, 4
 * and 5 positions are tied for priority based on first pass CIP rules (atom
 * numbner and mass). However, 3 and 5 are quickly seen as higher priority than
 * 4' in the first tie-break as 4' has no sub-ligands. 3 and 5, however, both
 * have 2 sub-ligands. 3 has [3',2] and 5 has [5',6] as sub-ligands. The next 
 * step CDK CIP rules do is to ORDER these sub-ligands and then compare them.
 * In this case, we need to order [3',2] and [5',6] individually. For [3',2],
 * this is done by comparing only the ATOMIC NUMBER+MASS between 3' and 2,
 * and since they are both carbon atoms, this will result in a tie. This means
 * that if the starting order of [3',2] was [3',2] it will remain that way. If
 * the starting order is [2,3'] it will remain [2,3']. Since the input order
 * of the ligands is based on read-order (order of bonds in the bond table in
 * the CTAB, for example), this means the ordering of the sub-ligands is effectively
 * non-deterministic. 2 is certainly higher priority than 3' in full CIP rules,
 * and 6 is higher priorty than 5' as well. In the above cases there are 4 ways
 * the ligand ordering can go
 * <pre>
 * Possibility 1: both sub-ligands in right order
 *    3 vs 5 =>
 *    [2,3'] vs [6,5'] => 
 *    2 vs 6 => 2 is higher priority
 *    therefore 3 is higher priority (correct)
 * 
 * Possibility 2: 3 sub-ligands wrong order, 5 right order
 *    3 vs 5 =>
 *    [3',2] vs [6,5'] => 
 *    3' vs 6 => 6 is higher priority
 *    therefore 5 is higher priority (incorrect)
 * 
 * Possibility 3: 3 sub-ligands RIGHT order, 5 wrong order
 *    3 vs 5 =>
 *    [2,3'] vs [5',6] => 
 *    2 vs 5' => 2 is higher priority
 *    therefore 3 is higher priority (correct)
 * 
 * Possibility 4: both sub-ligands in WRONG order
 *    3 vs 5 =>
 *    [3',2] vs [5',6] => 
 *    3' vs 5' => TIE, go to next
 *    2 vs 6 => 2 is higher priority
 *    therefore 3 is higher priority (correct)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Notice here that 3 of the 4 possibilities above will give the correct
 * CIP ordering. This is indeed typical. The bug only applies in circumstances
 * where 2 or more "principal" ligands are tied for CIP priority based on
 * atom number and atomic weight AND those 2 ligands both have sub-ligands 
 * (non-hydrogens) AND at least 2 sub-ligands of those ligands are tied for
 * atomic weight and atomic mass. Even still, the majority of the time the
 * criteria is met, CDK will still produce the correct CIP labeling.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class corrects the bug by switching how the ordering is done to instead
 * call the full CIP ordering for sub-ligands. This is potentially computationally
 * more expensive. The actual code here is largely just copy/pasted methods needed
 * to perform the same methods as {@link CIPTool} and a reference to a modified {@link CIPLigandRule}
 * (called {@link CIPLigandRule2}).
 * 
 * </p>
